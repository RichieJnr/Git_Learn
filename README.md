I'm a beginner in coding and it's getting interesting by the day.
Thanks to PyData Ghana for this opportunity to realise a dream.
It's been tough but little by little, I'm making progress. 
First time on Github and I have been able to create a repo; a step forward.
I will continue to grow from here and I'll look back on this someday and appreciate how far I have come on this journey.
